# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
The aim of run_analysis.r is to create a tidy data set based on mean and standard deviation of each measurement in Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. At very first step, all the needed data set will be loaded in internal storage, and data in train and test will be merged into one data set. Then, the programme will create a new table including only subject, activity, mean and standard deviation of each measurement. After that, the variables's name will be translated to readable words. Finally, the data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject will be created.The final data set can be found in the "smart_tidy_data.txt".
